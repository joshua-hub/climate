Problem 2:
1)
a = 0.006441x
b = -12.516860
E/n = 1.279371
sqrt(E/n) \approx 1.1

Our assignment sheet states that if E/n is significantly greater than 1 then a 
linear model does not fit the data. I did read through some linear regression 
statistical pages, and I couldn't find how 'significant' would be defined. 
I would not say that 1.28 is significantly larger than 1, and by looking at my
plot I would say that a linear model does best describe the full data set, 
however there is some variation in the model which could also be described with
more complicated functions.

2)
a = 0.012306
b = -24.155854
E/n = 0.815008
sqrt(E/n) \approx 0.9

This error is less than 1, which I would say significantly increases the 
linearity of the data (within these bounds). It is also aparent by looking at 
the plot visually that there is less non-linearity in the function, this is not
of any mathematical argument though. But minimiming the average error, means 
that the line of best fit is closer to all of the data points than a larger 
E/n.


3)
Using the equation for the line of best fit over the while data set, 
Temperature anomaly = 0.006441*(year) -12.516860; in 2050, Temperature anomaly 
in 2050 will be 0.68719


Problem 5:
The 5 maximum temperature anomalies in this dataset are as follows
Temperature anomaly  	 Date 
0.793200 		           2002.166667
0.855300 		           1998.166667
0.794600 		           2010.250000
0.783700 		           2002.250000
0.854000 		           2007.083333

Note: 2002.000 is january 2002, 2002.083 is february 2002, etc.
